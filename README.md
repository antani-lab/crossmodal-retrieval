# crossmodal-retrieval
<p>This repository demonstrates the training and evaluation of crossmodal retreival of chest X-ray (CXR) images based on the BiomedCLIP model from Hugging Face Hub. </p>
<p>The supCon_training.ipynb notebook shows how to define and fine-tune the BiomedCLIP model using multi-task supervised contrastive learning. </p>
<p></p>The clip_retrieval_eval.ipynb notebook shows how to evaluate the fine-tuned model for cross modal retrieval using a FAISS vector database. </p>
