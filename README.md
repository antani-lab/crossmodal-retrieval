# crossmodal-retrieval
This repository demonstrates the training and evaluation of crossmodal retreival of chest X-ray (CXR) images based on the BiomedCLIP model from Hugging Face Hub.
The supCon_training.ipynb notebook shows how to define and fine-tune the BiomedCLIP model using multi-task supervised contrastive learning.
The clip_retrieval_eval.ipynb notebook shows how to evaluate the fine-tuned model for cross modal retrieval using a FAISS vector database.
